            <p className={styles.emphasis}>
              Due to the nature of our digital service, Xplaino operates with a <strong>commitment to 
              quality and immediate access</strong>. We kindly ask you to understand that purchases and 
              subscriptions are generally not eligible for refunds.

          <h2>1. Policy Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Xplaino is operated by <strong>Subhram Subhrajyoti Rana</strong> (sole proprietor), doing business 
            as Xplaino. This Refund Policy ("Policy") governs all transactions related to the Xplaino Chrome 
            Extension ("Extension", "Service", "we", "us", or "our"). By purchasing, subscribing to, or using 
            any paid features of the Extension, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to 
            be bound by this Policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            All payments, billing, and refunds for Xplaino are processed through <strong>Paddle.com Market 
            Ltd</strong> ("Paddle"), which acts as the Merchant of Record for all transactions. You may see 
            "Paddle.net" or "Paddle" on your bank or credit card statements for charges related to Xplaino.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Please note that purchases are generally considered complete upon confirmation.</strong> We 
            understand this is an important consideration, and while we typically cannot offer refunds, returns, 
            or exchanges, we remain committed to working with you on any concerns, and will always honor 
            applicable legal requirements.

          <h2>2. Nature of Digital Service</h2>
          <p>
            Xplaino is a digital software service delivered as a Chrome browser extension. The nature of 
            digital products and services means that:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Once the Extension is installed and activated, you have immediate access to all features</li>
            <li>Digital services cannot be "returned" in the traditional sense</li>
            <li>All features are available immediately upon purchase or subscription activation</li>
            <li>The Extension can be used immediately without physical delivery delays</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We hope you understand that due to the immediate and intangible nature of digital services, 
            processing refunds after a purchase is completed or a subscription is activated presents 
            significant challenges. We appreciate your understanding of this aspect of digital products.
          </p>

        <section className={styles.section}>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Subscription Activation:</strong> Your subscription begins immediately upon purchase 
            and payment confirmation.</li>
            <li><strong>Automatic Renewal:</strong> Subscriptions may automatically renew at the end of each 
            billing period unless cancelled before the renewal date.</li>
            <li><strong>Cancellation:</strong> You have the flexibility to cancel your subscription at any time 
            through your account settings or by contacting us. Please note that while cancellation will prevent 
            future charges, the current billing period will remain active until its natural conclusion.</li>
            <li><strong>Partial Period Policy:</strong> We kindly ask for your understanding that unused 
            portions of subscription periods are not eligible for refunds, as access to all features remains 
            available throughout the entire billing period.</li>
            <li><strong>Immediate Access:</strong> Once payment is processed, you have immediate access 
            to all subscription features for the entire billing period.</li>

            evaluating each active subscription fairly on a case-by-case basis</li>

          <h2>9. Legal Requirements</h2>
          <p>
            This Policy does not affect your statutory rights as a consumer. If you are located in a

          <p>
            In particular, if you are located in the European Union, you may have a 14-day right of 
            withdrawal for digital content, but this right may be waived if you have consented to 
            immediate performance and acknowledged that you will lose your right of withdrawal.
